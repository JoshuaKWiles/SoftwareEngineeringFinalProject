Release 0.1

This release is comprised of the executable for the UI.

Because of the project setbacks, the two frontend and backend portions are incomplete and not linked. 

Goal: Create a working demo
	To supplement the issue, code has been implimented into the frontend that allows it to read event data from a text file in place of a C++ program.

Inputs:
	input.txt with properly formatted event data
Output: 
	UI with dynamically allocated containers for event data
